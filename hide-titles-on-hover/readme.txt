Hide tooltip when hover on links or whatever elements having a title attribute. But still keep the accessibility.


== Description ==

Normally, when you go with your mouse over an element that has a title attribute, a tooltip will appear on the screen.

After activation Hide Titles On Hover  will replace all the titles attributes with aria-label. You will have no problems with the accessibility, but you will not see the native tooltip of the browser on hover.

No settings, just activate it and that's it.

== Removing link tooltips helps to create a cleaner, more focused design for your WordPress site, enhancing user experience by eliminating unwanted distractions. Hereâ€™s how hiding tooltips can benefit your site: ==
* Improved UX: Removing tooltips helps visitors concentrate on your content.
* Cleaner Aesthetic: Tooltip-free links contribute to a minimalist, distraction-free interface.
* Accessibility Improvements: Screen readers already handle link descriptions, so removing the tooltip can streamline navigation for all users.
