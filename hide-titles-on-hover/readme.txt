Hide browser tooltips on hover while preserving accessibility for screen readers.



== Description ==

Remove native browser tooltips while preserving accessibility.

By default, when you hover over an element with a title attribute, the browser displays a native tooltip. These tooltips often don’t match your website’s design and can be distracting or redundant.

Hide Titles On Hover solves this by replacing all title attributes with aria-label attributes. This preserves accessibility for screen readers while preventing tooltips from appearing on hover.

🎯 No settings required. Just install and activate.

== ✅ Key Features ==
🔧 Automatically removes all native browser tooltips

♿ Fully accessible via aria-label for screen readers

⚡ Zero configuration – plug and play

🌐 Works site-wide out of the box

🔍 Want to disable it on specific pages?
While the plugin doesn’t have built-in settings, you can selectively disable it using the free plugin Freesoul Deactivate Plugins.

This allows you to deactivate Hide Titles On Hover only on pages where you still want tooltips to appear.
